# Data Science Project

## Project Overview

This data science project analyzes student visiting patterns, time spent at different locations, and develops predictive models to understand student movement and time allocation. The project uses machine learning techniques to cluster and classify student visits based on time differences and locations.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Multiple Machine Learning Models:
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Clustering Analysis with K-Means
- Visualization of Student Movements and Time Spent

## Dependencies

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Data Preprocessing Steps

- Cleaned and standardized visiting place names.
- Handled missing values.
- Converted time formats.
- Created time difference calculations.
- Encoded categorical variables.

## Visualizations

The project includes various visualizations:
- Confusion Matrix.
- Correlation Heatmap.
- K-Means Clustering Plot.
- Time Difference by Visiting Place Pie Chart.
- Peak Out Times Histogram.
- Date vs Year of Study Bar Plot.

## Key Insights

- Analyzed student visit patterns across different locations.
- Identified peak out times.
- Clustered student visits using K-Means algorithm.
- Predicted visiting places based on time spent.
